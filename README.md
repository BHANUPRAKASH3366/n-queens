Create a chessboard of NxN (where N is 8) matrix with all elements 0.
Create a function to check if we can place a queen there or not, queen will not be placed if the place is being attacked or already occupied by another queen.
In that function check vertically and horizontally to find whether there are other queens or not.
Also check diagonal positions.
Place the queen if it is not being attacked by any other queen.
Do recursion to check wether we can put the next queen with this arrangment or not.
End when all queens are placed.
